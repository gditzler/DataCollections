# About 

The NOAA weather data was put together by Ryan Elwell for prediction tasks in nonstationary environments. Weather dataset collected from the NOAA's website and it contains 8 features and approximately 50 years worth of data from Bellevue, Nebraska. Daily measurements were taken for a variety of features like temperature, pressure, visibility, wind speed, etc. The number of features were reduced to eight features (average/minimum/maximum temperature, dew point, sea level pressure, visibility, average/maximum wind speed) and the classification task was to predict whether or not it rained on a particular day.
